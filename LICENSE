The core of this stuff is all from the book and copyrighted by the publisher.
For my part, I don't care what you do with it, but they might take exception.

For the rest of it:  not my fault if you use this and it doesn't work or it, unexpectedly or otherwise, breaks something.

Use at your own risk!

Good luck and God's speed!
